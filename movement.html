     <h1>What is Movement?</h1>
       <h2>Textbook Definition</h2>
       <p>"The principle of movement goes back to the idea that good design controls the eye's flow through the composition"(pg 57).</p>
       <p>"Horizontal lines communicate movement flowing left to right or right to left"(pg 58).</p>
       <p>"Vertical lines tend to communicate stability, such as tress and all buildings. Vertical lines also may communicate inspirational upward movement... or downward movement"(pg 58).</p>
       <p>"Diagonal lines communicate exciting dynamic movement. Two converging diagonal lines communicate distance"(pg 58).</p>
       <p>"The bottom line for movement and flow is that you want to move the eye across the layout in order to convey information as well as to evoke emotion"(pg 58).</p>

       <h2>Breaking It Down</h2>
       <p>Movement is crucial to a successful layout. Your reader should not have to stop reading to figure out where they should go next. </p>
        <p>Feel free to use a mixture of lines however, your layout should never appear too busy. </p> 
       <p>The circular pattern is your best option because it will lead viewers to the beginning of layout once again, to examine it as a whole. </p>
 <h2>Real World Example</h2>
    <figure>
     <img src="movement.jpeg" class="responsive" alt="Bad Ass Babes Club tapestry"/>
     <figcaption>This is a tapestry.
     </figcaption>
   </figure>
       <p></p>
       <p>This tapestry is a good example of movement because it is easy to read. It is very simplistic which makes it easy for someone to follow.</p>
       <p>People read from left to right, which is exactly how it reads on the tapestry. The lines are all horizontal so their isn't a random switch somewhere in the middle.</p>
       
       <h2>DSLR Camera Example</h2>
       <figure>
       <img src="movement2.jpeg" class="responsive" alt="Preddrew-Yates Hall"/>
           <figcaption>This is a residence hall sign on Virginia Tech's campus.</figcaption>
       </figure>
       <p></p>
       <p>This is another great example of movement because the eye gets drawn to the name first, but right underneath of it is the address.</p>
       <p>It is simple and doesn't distract the eye from the flow of the sign.</p>
