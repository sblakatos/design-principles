     <h1>What is Balance?</h1>
       <h2>Textbook Definition</h2>
     <p>"You want your designs and layouts to be visually balanced, unless your communication purpose is to unsettle people by making them feel unbalanced and tense or anxious. There are three kinds of visual balance: radical, symmetrical, and asymmetrical"(pg 56).</p>
       <ul>
        <li>Radical</li>
            <ul>
      <li>"Radical balance refers to circular designs in which the fulcrum lies at the center...Interestingly, wherever you split the radical balance, you end up with two symmetrical halves. Only radical designs have that property"(pg 57).</li></ul>
       
    <li>Symmetry</li>
       <ul>
       <li>"Whatever the shape, to achieve symmetrical balance, each side of the bisected design must be a mirror image of the other in terms of visual weight. This is called formal balance"(pg 57).</li></ul>
       
   <li>Asymmetry</li>
        <ul>
        <li>"...reveals two unequal sides if bisected. Asymmetrical balance tends to be more visually exciting, or at least more visually interesting, than symmetrical balance"(pg 57).</li></ul>
           </ul>

<h2>Breaking It Down</h2>
        
    <p>Balance is what makes your layout visually pleasing. Having too much positive/negative space can make the layout feel awkward and unprofessional. If you put a lot dark tones, you must counteract it with light tones, as well.</p>
        
    <p>There are multiple strategies to achieve balance: radical, symmetrical, and asymmetrical. While they have varying principles such as looking identical if split down the middle or having the focal point in the center, each approach successfully achieves its goal. To provide the viewer with a sense of comfort. What they are looking at will not overwhelm them or leave them confused.</p>
    <h2>Real World Example</h2>
    <figure>
     <img src="balance.jpeg" class="responsive" alt="Symmetrical side table"/>
     <figcaption>This is a side table.
     </figcaption>
   </figure>
       <p></p>
       
       <p>This is a good example of balance because it demonstrates one of the three kinds. Symmetry.If you split the table down the middle, it would still be the same on both sides.</p>
       <p>This type of balance is aesthetically pleasing for people because it is a familiar pattern. There is symmetry in most things, people may just not realize it right away.</p>
