     <h1>What is Rhythm?</h1>
       <h2>Textbook Definition</h2>
     <p>"In graphic design, rhythmic movement has to do with repeating items strategically - kind of like a backbeat"(pg 59).</p>
        <p>"Using columns to keep your legs of type uniform creates rhythm. Grouping several photos establishes a rhythm. Repeating your fonts throughout a layout generates rhythm"(pg 59).</p>
        <p>"Such visual rhythm not only results in visual sense of togetherness for the layout but also helps lead the eye from one thing to another"(pg 59).</p>
       <p><cite>White Space is Not Your Enemy</cite> by Rebecca Hagen and Kim Golombisky. Published in 2017 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</p>
       
       <h2>Breaking It Down</h2>
       <p>To create rhythm, repetition is going to be your best friend. Repetition will give your viewers a sense of familiarity. </p>
       <p> If you introduced something new halfway through the layout, that may cause anxiety among the viewer, making them think they missed something important. Shapes, fonts, colors, etc. Nothing is off limits!</p>

       <p>This picture demonstrates rhythm in it's most basic form. Rhythm is a pattern that relies heavily on repetition.</p>
       <p>If a stair were missing, it would ruin the flow of the stairs. It would also cause the person using the stairs to take a second look, which would lead them to be distracted.</p>
       <p>Rhythm is familiar to people without them even noticing it's there. When you go up the stairs, you don't think about each step, you just assume that the pattern will continue.</p>
